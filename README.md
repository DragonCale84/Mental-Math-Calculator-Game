# Mental-Math-Calculator-Game

A game designed to allow mental math to be played in a fun way without high stress. Designed to be very UI/ UX friendly, and is played with alongside a fun Python turtle module!

Mental-Math-Calculator-Game was a personal project meant to meet the desired audiences who enjoy a little challenge to enhance their minds with quick responses to mental math as a timer is incremented and set against them to test their abilities in solving math to the quickest time that they can. It was designed to be a little tricky in mind to reach the desired target goal to ensure that questions aren't too simple yet impossible to solve by everyone and anyone.
